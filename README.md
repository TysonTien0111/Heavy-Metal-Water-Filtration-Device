# Heavy Metal Water Filtration Device System (Project Aquatus)

A portfolio entry documenting "Aquatus," an embedded systems project that combined hardware design and C++ software to create a functional, autonomous heavy metal water filtration prototype. The system was designed as a low-cost, wildlife-safe solution to heavy metal contamination in urban ponds.

**This repository serves as a showcase of the project's final design, validated performance data, and my specific contributions to the control software.**

## Project Artifact: Official Poster

The primary artifact for this project is the official poster presented to an audience of 50+ engineering professionals and peers. It contains the complete project overview, including:
*   Circuit Diagrams and Code Flowchart
*   TDS Sensor Calibration Data
*   Results from Watertight and Floatation Tests
*   Overall Design Concept and Features

## My Role: Software & Control Systems

As the lead for the software component, my core contribution was engineering the C++ control program for the Arduino platform. The software was responsible for:
*   Implementing a real-time feedback loop based on sensor data.
*   Controlling physical actuators (water pump) and indicators (LEDs).
*   Executing the core system logic as detailed in the flowchart on the poster.

A detailed statement of my contributions can be found in the `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` file.
